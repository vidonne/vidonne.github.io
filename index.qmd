Information Management Officer at [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/) specialized in data visualization and mapping.

Proud creator of the [UNHCR Data Visualization Platform](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/) and its related [guidelines](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/assets/download/UNHCR_Data_Visualization_Guidelines.pdf), [recommendations](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/chart_gallery/) on chart selection and [tools](https://dataviz.unhcr.org/tools/) to build branded graphics.

Recently started my [R](https://www.r-project.org/) journey, making more and more visualizations using [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and being audacious enough to build some R packages.
